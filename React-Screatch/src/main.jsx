// createRoot is a function provided by React 18.
// It‚Äôs used to create a place (a React root) where your React app can be rendered into the actual DOM.

// üß± What is "root"?
// In React, the "root" is a div in your HTML like this:


// That‚Äôs just plain HTML. Nothing dynamic yet.
// We need to tell React:

// "Hey! Take over this div and manage everything inside it."

// That‚Äôs where createRoot() comes in.

// const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
// This line tells React:

// ‚ÄúThis is your entry zone. From now on, you control everything inside this #root div.‚Äù

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

// React evaluates the JSX, renders it into HTML, and inserts it inside the div#root.

// That‚Äôs why we use the word "render".
// We're rendering a component into the real DOM.

root.render(<App />);
